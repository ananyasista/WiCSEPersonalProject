        Women Engineers (SWE) and CACI, I aided in implementing a \
        C++ satellite scheduler algorithm that reads in TLE data and \
        calculates a 7-day schedule of eligible satellites for a pre-determined \
        ground station to detect.",

         design to build a function that evaluated 70+ satellites per day and added them \
         to a schedule based off start/endtime while avoiding overlaps",

        architecture, and a list of needed external contributons.",
